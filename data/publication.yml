    bio: |
      Born in Sofia, Bulgaria, Irina Bokova was the director-general of UNESCO for two terms, from 2009 to 2017. She is the first woman to lead the organization. As director-general, Bokova was actively engaged in the UN efforts to adopt Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, focusing on quality education, gender equality, and the protection of the world’s cultural heritage.

      After graduating from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Bokova was a fellow at the University of Maryland, Washington, and participated in an executive program at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.

      Before being elected director-general of UNESCO, from 2005 to 2009 Bokova was ambassador of Bulgaria to France, Monaco, and UNESCO, and personal representative of the President of the Republic of Bulgaria to the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF).

      Irina Bokova has received state distinctions from countries across the world and has been awarded an *honoris causa* degree from more than forty universities. She was also on the Forbes list of the world’s most influential women for 2016. In 2020 she was elected international honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
