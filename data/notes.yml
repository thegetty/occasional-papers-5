#[^34]: The strategy specifically indicates that the term “cultural cleansing” is not a legal term, and was used by me for the first time in a public statement on the situation in Iraq in August 2014, and that it has since been used in public statements, speeches, and interviews to raise awareness of the systematic and deliberate nature of attacks on cultural heritage and diversity perpetrated by violent extremist groups in Syria and Iraq.

#[^35]: The Responsibility to Protect is an international norm that seeks to ensure that the international community never again fails to halt the mass atrocity crimes of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. The concept emerged in response to the failure of the international community to adequately respond to mass atrocities committed in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia during the 1990s.
